### Procedure

a) Circuit formulation:
<br>
1.	Select the “box”.
2.	Select the correct component to be placed in the “box”.
3.	Repeat for all the “boxes”.
4.	After completing all connections click on “check” connection button and verify the connections.<br>
    a). If all connections are correct then “This is Buck Converter” will appear.<br>
  	b). If any connection is incorrect then try again to form the correct buck converter circuit.<br>
  	c). Try at least 5 times to see the correct circuit by clicking on “Hint” button.<br>

b) Operating the circuit: 
<br>
1) Set the values of Source Voltage (V<sub>g</sub>), Load Resistance (R) and Duty Ratio (D).<br>
2) Press “RECORD” button to simulate the circuit and observe various waveforms.<br>
3) Change “V<sub>in</sub>, R and D” to observe the waveforms at different operating conditions.<br>

c) Performance analysis of the circuit: 
 <br>
1) Set the values of Source Voltage (V<sub>in</sub>), Load Resistance (R) and Duty Ratio (D).
2) Select the “ICONS” in sequence to analyse and understand the circuit operation and performance.
3) Follow the instructions given in respective experiment slide and press the “RECORD” button to fill the observation table.
